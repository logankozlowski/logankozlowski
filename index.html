            <h2>Problem statement: Student Transportation</h2>
            <p>
                The transportation provided by the university or lack thereof, is not enough for the everyday college
                student.
                The busses either aren't on time, being too early or too late, or their stops are in inconvenient spots
                where the 20-minute walk would be faster.

<p>
    For our affinity diagram regarding transportation for students on campus, we covered 5 major categories. Those being E-bikes, E-scooters,
    an application to track those E-devices, student bus transportation, and charging stations for any electric transportation devices that
    may be necessary.
